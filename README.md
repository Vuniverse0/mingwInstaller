# mingwInstaller
Online installer of MinGW-W64 with GUI


Libs I use:

  -[fltk](https://www.fltk.org/)
  
  -[curl](https://curl.se/libcurl/)
  
I also use 7z sources(part of [lzma dev kit](https://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html)).

All icons are in binary and all libs linked staticaly, so you need only one [.exe](https://github.com/Vuniverse0/mingwInstaller/releases) file to run installer.
